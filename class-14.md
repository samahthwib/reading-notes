### **Transforms**

The <transform> property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

*2D Transforms* : Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axisÿ≤
transform elements : rotate , Scale , Translate , Skew
the default transform origin is the dead center of an element, both 50% horizontally and 50% vertically. To change this default origin position the <transform-origin> property may be used.

**Transitions & Animations**
With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.
Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

Transitional Properties: 
* Transition Duration
* Transition Timing
* Transition Delay

Animations : To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.
