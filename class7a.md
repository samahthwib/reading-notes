### **REST**

* HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol.is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands

* **A web page** is a representation of a resource. 
* **Resources** are just concepts. 
* **URLs**:  tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept.
* **Web Services** or **APIs**. It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do.

* **Machines** don't have a universal noun - that's why they suck. Every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of talking about nouns. That's why the URL is so important. It let's all of these systems tell each other about each other's nouns.
