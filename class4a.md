**Grid**


*CSS Grid Layout* is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system.

## some Grid property:
<display>
Defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.

<grid-template-columns> <grid-template-rows>
Defines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values. The values represent the track size, and the space between them represents the grid line.

<grid-column-start> <grid-column-end>
Determines a grid itemâ€™s location within the grid by referring to specific grid lines.

<grid-column> <grid-row>

<grid-area>
Gives an item a name so that it can be referenced by a template created with the grid-template-areas property.

<grid-template-areas>
Defines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas which are specified with the grid-area property.

<justify-self>
Aligns a grid item inside a cell along the inline (row) axis (as opposed to align-self which aligns along the block (column) axis). This value applies to a grid item inside a single cell.

<grid-column-gap><grid-row-gap>
Specifies the size of the grid lines.
