refer to different elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to
your site. A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.

types of form controls:
1. Adding Text 
2. Making Choice 
3. Submitting Forms

##### Form Structure
`<form>` tag , have *action* and *method*

Then : `<input>` tag , have *type* , *value* and *name* 

`<label>` , `<fieldset>` , `<legend>`

form validation : messages giveen to users if the form control has not been filled in correctly.
HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.

There are several CSS properties that were created to work with specific types of HTML elements, such as lists, tables, and forms.

1. Bullet Point Styles : list-style-type
2. Images for Bullets : list-style-image
3. Positioning the Marker : list-style-position
4. List Shorthand : list-style
5. Border on Empty Cells empty-cells

Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.

### **EVENTS**

events that occur in the browser while you are browsing the web. Any of these events can be used to trigger a function
in your JavaScript code. for example : load , unload , error , resize .

When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code. Together these steps are known as event handling:

1. Selectt he element node(s) you want the script to respond to.
2. Indicate which event on the selected node(s) will trigger the response.
3. State the code you want to run when the event occurs.
4. Event listeners are a more recent approach to handling events.They can deal with more than one function at a time
but they are not supported in older browsers.
