### **Node.js**

### *Node.js* is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library. so, it is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.


### Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry. 
### We can also install packages locally to a project, as opposed to globally, on our system. 


### Node and npm used for installing running various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application. 
### Node.js is single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.

### Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration , where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else. It’s also a good fit for building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven or for sites involving data streaming, as Node makes it possible to process files while they’re still being uploaded.

### Advantages of Node.js:
1. speed 
2. scalability
3. your brain no longer needs to switch modes. You can do everything in the same language,so you can easily share code between the server and the client.

## **JSON** is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases so when you’re working with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting. You can have one syntax from browser to server to database.

### transitioning from javascript to Node development is potentially easier than to other server-side languages.
