## CSS
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.for example:

p {
font-family: Arial;}

h1, h2, h3 {
font-family: Arial;
color: yellow;}

You can add the CSS code in three ways:
1- inline
2- internal
3- external 

**CSS Selectors** : There are many different types of CSS selector that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document. for example : Class Selector , ID Selector amd Type Selector.


## JavaScript

**statement** A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.it should end with a semicolon.
**Comments** to explain what your code does.They help make your code easier to read and understand.This can help you and others who read your code.
**Variables** A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.
variable declaration : var variable name;
**Data type** JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans.
**Array** An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. And values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).
**Operators** expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.Types of operators : ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS,ARITHMETIC OPERATORS,STRING OPERATORS,LOGICAL OPERATORS,COMPARISON OPERATORS.

## Decisions and Loops 
There are two components to a decision:
1. An expression is evaluated,which returns a value.
2. A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation.

If statements : a condition, if the condition evaluates to true,any statements in the subsequent code block are executed.

**Comparison operators** (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.

**Logical operators** allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
