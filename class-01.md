### HTML,CSS,JavaScript

###### All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix. So,before we look about  the code used to build websites it’s important to know  how the web works ?
###### When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

**HTML** Describes the Structure of Pages by using elements. it has Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags. For example: 
* <p> </p>
* <html> </html>
* <body> </body>

**Attributes** provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign. For example:<a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link</a>
**<body>** Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
**<head>** This contains information about the page.
**<title>** The contents of this element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit.


**Extra Markup**
Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML. Each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last:
* HTML 4
* XHTML 1.0
* HTML5

**DOCTYPE** Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using
For example : Html5  <!DOCTYPE html>

**Comments** If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters: <!-- comment goes here -->
**ID attribute** It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page and it allows you to style it differently than any other instance of the same element on the page. It is important that no two
elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes
**Class attribute** Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements
as being different from the other elements on the page.

**BLOCKELEMENTS** Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements. Examples of block elements are
<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.


###### Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.Examples of inline elements are <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>.

**Grouping Text & Elements In a Block:**
1-	The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
2-	The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> element

**<meta>** element lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page.and It is not visible to users.

**HTML5 Layout** HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.

**<nav>** element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
**<article>** element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
**<section>** element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is. And you should  know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason

so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively. Now you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.
**wireframe** is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also
helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.
