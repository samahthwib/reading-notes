## **Node.js**

### is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications. It's written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on any platform.

### I buit a small server using node.js then to make sure that is a server I put my laptop's IP address and the port so after that i can see my sever on my smart phone .

### so I got here is my own *client-server model*, which can fit in my bag! Take it any place I want! It will be a good idea to deploy our server online, so everyone could see it.

### Node.js provides you with non-blocking and event-driven behavior.
### Node allows you to use the so-called event loop, which works faster because of non-blocking behavior.

### Now it works locally. **WWW** is for *"World Wide Web"* so I turned my local server into a world wide server. I used Heroku cloud application platform for this.

### **Heroku** is a cloud platform as a service (cool long-bearded programmer guys call such type of things "PaaS"). It allows you to deploy your web server, so everyone could see how awesome you are as a web developer.
