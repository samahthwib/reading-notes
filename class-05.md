### **Images**

You might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.
A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

we use `<img>` tag to add images , It must carry the following attributes: 
1. src : This tells the browser where it can find the image file.
2. alt : This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it. 
3. title : You can also use the title attribute with the `<img>` element
to provide additional information about the image. 

Three Rules for Creating Images :
* Save images in the right format
* Save images at the right size
* Use the correct resolution

There are alot of properties for images like :
Image Formats / Image Dimensions / Cropping Images / Image Resolution / Vector Images / Animated GIFs / Transparency

### **Color**
When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.

*CSS3* introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.

*CSS3* has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

*CSS3* also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

### **Text**
The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:
1. Those that directly affect the font and its appearance
2. Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using

properties that we can use it :
`font-family` / `font-size` / `@font-face` / `font-weight`/ `font-style` / `text-transform` / `text-decoration` / `line-height` / `letter-spacing` /`word-spacing` / `text-align` / `vertical-align` /
`@font-face` computer of the person browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the font, which will be downloaded if
it is not on the user's machine.

There are three pseudo-classe that allow you to change the appearance of elements when a user is interacting with them.
 :hover, :active, :focus
