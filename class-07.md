### **Domain Modeling**
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

#### **Tables**   

The `<table>` element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.

You indicate the start of each row using the opening `<tr>` tag.
Each cell of a table is represented using a `<td>` element.

The `<th>` element is used just like the `<td>` element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row.
For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.

#### **Objects**

**this**  The keyword *this* is commonly used inside functions and objects.
Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers
to one object, usually the object in which the function operates
 
In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs.
To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of
related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.

Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the
browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These
built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.

The window object represents the current browser window or tab. It is the topmost object in the Browser Object Model, and it contains other objects that tell you about the browser

Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
