**Javascript Templating**

1. Mustache
is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.
If you intend you use mustache with Node and Express, you can use mustache-express. Mustache Express lets you use Mustache and Express together easily.

**Flexbox**

Properties for the Parent :

*display*
This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.

*flex-direction*
This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. 

*flex-wrap*
By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.

*flex-flow*
This is a shorthand for the <flex-direction> and <flex-wrap> properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is <row nowrap>.


------------------------------------


Properties for the Children :

*order*
By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.

*flex-grow*
This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.

*flex-shrink*
This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.

*flex-basis*
This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed.
