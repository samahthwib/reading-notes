### **Images**

You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS

By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the <display> property with a value of block.

The <background-image> property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

The background-repeat property can have four values:
1. repeat
2. repeat-x
3. repeat-y
4. no-repeat

The background-attachment:
1. fixed
2. scroll

background-position : top , bottom , left , right
The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the <background-color> property.

CSS3 is going to introduce the ability to specify a gradient for the background of a box. The gradient is created using the background-image property
and, at the time of writing, different browsers required a different syntax.
