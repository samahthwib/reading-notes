### **functional programming**
##### is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 

### fundamental concept:
* functional programming is pure functions : It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
* Immutability : Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
* Referential transparency

`pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency`

* Functions as first-class entities : The functions are treated as values and used as data.
* Higher-order functions : a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result
* Filter
* Map : transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values.
* Reduce :  receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.
